## Signing Up
1. Navigate to `/sign-up` and create an account using the Clerk sign‑up form.
2. After registering you will be redirected to the `/dashboard` where you can begin creating shows.

## The Dashboard
The dashboard is your command center. A **Quick Access** panel lets you switch between different views for shows, venues, departments and crew members. The panel items use icons and descriptions for clarity.

## Managing Shows
Select **Shows** in the Quick Access panel to view your list of shows. Use the **Create Show** button to add a new production or select an existing show to view its scripts. You can also create scripts directly from the show card.

## Venues, Departments, and Crew
Other Quick Access views let you manage venues, departments and crew members. Each view provides creation buttons and cards for editing or deleting records.

## Working With Scripts
From a show card choose **Scripts** to open the script manager. Scripts have multiple modes:
- **View** – read the script without editing.
- **Play** – performance playback (coming soon).
- **Info** – edit script details like start time or notes.
- **Edit** – add or rearrange script elements.
- **Share** – collaboration features (coming soon).
Use the toolbar at the top of the page to switch modes and return to the dashboard when finished.

## Help and Documentation
Open the **Options** menu in the Quick Access panel to access tutorials, test tools, API documentation and the full documentation browser. Documentation is grouped by category and rendered directly inside the application.
