# Getting Started - Your Questions Answered

**The Most Common Questions from New Cuebe Users**

---

## About Cuebe Basics

### Q: What exactly is Cuebe? 
**A:** Think of Cuebe as your digital stage manager - it keeps track of all your production information, helps your team collaborate in real-time, and makes sure nobody misses important updates. It's specifically designed for theater people by theater people.

### Q: Do I need to be "tech-savvy" to use this?
**A:** Not at all! If you can send text messages or use email, you can use Cuebe. We've designed it to work the way theater people naturally think about productions. You don't need any special technical knowledge.

### Q: How is this different from just using Google Docs or email?
**A:** Google Docs and email aren't designed for theater productions. Cuebe understands cues, timing, departments, and the way theater people work together. Plus, it keeps everything organized in one place instead of scattered across multiple documents and email threads.

### Q: What if my theater doesn't have great internet?
**A:** Cuebe works on any internet connection. Once you load your script, you can work offline and your changes will sync when you get back online. The system is designed to work reliably even with basic connectivity.

## Setting Up Your First Production

### Q: Where do I start? I'm feeling overwhelmed.
**A:** Start with just creating your Show and inviting one other person - maybe your stage manager or lighting designer. You don't need to set up everything at once. Add one piece at a time as your production develops.

### Q: Can I try this with an existing production, or should I wait for a new show?
**A:** You can absolutely start with a show in progress! Many people find it helpful to start with something familiar. You can add your current script and see how the collaboration features work with your existing team.

### Q: What if I make a mistake setting something up?
**A:** Everything in Cuebe can be edited, reorganized, or renamed. Don't worry about getting it perfect the first time - you can always adjust as you learn what works best for your team.

### Q: How do I know what permissions to give people?
**A:** Start simple: give most people "Contributor" access so they can add information in their departments. You can always adjust permissions later as you see how people use the system.

## Working With Your Team

### Q: What if some of my team members don't want to use digital tools?
**A:** Start with the people who are excited about trying something new. As they see the benefits, others often become curious. You can also print out scripts from Cuebe for people who prefer paper, while still getting the coordination benefits.

### Q: Can people work on scripts at the same time without messing each other up?
**A:** Yes! Cuebe is designed for real-time collaboration. Multiple people can work on the same script simultaneously, and everyone sees updates immediately. There are safeguards to prevent accidental conflicts.

### Q: What's this "synchronized playback" feature I've heard about?
**A:** It's like having a conductor for your entire production team! The stage manager or director can start script playback, and everyone else's devices automatically follow along with the same timing, highlighting, and cues. Perfect for tech rehearsals and performances - no more "where are we?" confusion.

### Q: What happens if someone accidentally deletes something important?
**A:** Everything has a complete change history, so nothing is ever really "deleted." You can always see what was changed and restore previous versions if needed. Plus, only people with appropriate permissions can make major changes.

### Q: How do we handle guest directors or temporary crew members?
**A:** You can give people temporary access for specific time periods, or create "view-only" access for people who need to see information but not edit it. It's easy to add and remove people as your team changes.

## Current Features - What You Can Do Right Now

### Q: Can I import existing scripts?
**A:** Yes! You can upload most common file formats (PDF, Word, text files) and Cuebe will help you convert them into editable, collaborative scripts. We're constantly improving our import capabilities.

### Q: Does Cuebe work on phones and tablets?
**A:** Absolutely. Cuebe is designed to work on any device - phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer. You can check a cue during rehearsal on your phone, then go home and do detailed planning on your computer. The synchronized playback even works beautifully on phones - perfect for department heads who need to follow along from anywhere in the theater.

### Q: Can people join a synchronized script session without creating an account?
**A:** Yes! You can share special guest links that let people (like visiting directors, understudies, or temporary crew) follow along with synchronized playback without needing to create accounts. They'll see everything in real-time but won't be able to edit anything.

### Q: Can I print scripts from Cuebe?
**A:** Yes, you can export clean, printable versions of your scripts. You can choose what information to include - just dialogue, full technical notes, or specific department information.

### Q: What about security? Is our production information safe?
**A:** Very safe. Your production information is encrypted and secure. Only people you invite can see your shows, and you control exactly what each person can access. We take privacy and security seriously.

### Q: Can we use this for multiple shows at once?
**A:** Definitely! You can have as many productions as you want, and keep them completely separate. Your fall play, spring musical, and summer workshop can all have their own organization and teams.

## Future Features - What's Coming Soon

### Q: Will there be more script import options?
**A:** We're constantly improving script import capabilities. Soon you'll be able to import from more specialized theater software, and we're working on better automatic formatting recognition.

### Q: I heard something about AI helping write scripts - is that real?
**A:** Yes! We're developing AI features that can help with script creation and production planning. Imagine telling the system "I need a 30-minute version of Hamlet for three actors" and getting back suggested cuts, staging, and technical requirements. It's still in development, but very exciting!

### Q: What about integration with lighting and sound boards?
**A:** That's on our roadmap! We're working on ways to export cue information directly to professional lighting consoles and sound systems. This would eliminate re-entering information and reduce errors during technical rehearsals.

### Q: Will there be mobile apps?
**A:** Cuebe already works great on mobile browsers, but we are considering dedicated mobile apps for specific functions like stage management during performances or quick cue checking during rehearsals.

### Q: Any plans for budget management or scheduling features?
**A:** We're researching these areas! Many theater professionals have asked about production budgets, rehearsal scheduling, and resource management. These features would integrate with the existing show structure.

## Technical Questions

### Q: What if our internet goes out during a performance?
**A:** Once your script is loaded, you can work offline. Cuebe stores information locally on your device, so you can access your cues and notes even without internet. Changes will sync when connectivity returns. The synchronized playback does need internet to coordinate between devices, but each person still has full access to their script information.

### Q: How does the synchronized playback handle timing if someone joins late?
**A:** It's smart! When someone joins a synchronized session that's already in progress, their device automatically catches up to the current moment and adjusts all the timing to match where the show actually is. No manual catching up needed.

### Q: Can we backup our production information?
**A:** Yes! You can export complete backups of your shows, including all scripts, cues, and notes. You can also export specific information like cue sheets or contact lists.

### Q: Is there a limit to how many people can work on a production?
**A:** There are no artificial limits. Whether you're working with 5 people or 50, Cuebe scales to support your production size.

### Q: What happens to our information if we stop using Cuebe?
**A:** You always own your production information. You can export everything in standard formats that work with other software, so you're never locked in to using Cuebe if your needs change.

## Cost and Commitment Questions

### Q: Is there a free trial or demo version?
**A:** We offer options for new users to explore Cuebe without commitment. Contact us about trial options that work for your situation.

### Q: What's the pricing like for educational theater?
**A:** We offer special pricing for schools, community theaters, and educational productions. We believe cost shouldn't be a barrier to better production management.

### Q: Do we have to sign a long-term contract?
**A:** No long-term contracts required. We want you to use Cuebe because it helps your productions, not because you're locked into an agreement.
