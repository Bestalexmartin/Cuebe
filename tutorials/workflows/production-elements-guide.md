# Understanding Your Production Elements

**The Building Blocks of Your Digital Theater**

## Think of It Like This...

Just like every theater production has the same basic elements - a script, a cast, a venue, and different departments working together - Cuebe organizes everything around these same familiar concepts.

## The Five Core Elements

### 🎭 **Shows** - Your Production Container
Think of a **Show** as the master folder for your entire production. Whether you're doing "Hamlet," "The Laramie Project," or your original devised piece, the Show contains everything related to that production.

**What Goes in a Show:**
- Basic production information (title, dates, description)
- All scripts and versions for that production
- Cast and crew assignments
- Venue information
- Department organization

**Example:** "Macbeth - Spring 2025" would be one Show, even if you're doing multiple performances.

### 📖 **Scripts** - Your Living Playbook
A **Script** in Cuebe is much more than just dialogue. It's your complete production playbook with everything timed and organized.

**What Makes Scripts Powerful:**
- **Cues & Notes**: Add lighting cues, sound cues, actor notes, and technical reminders
- **Timing Information**: Track scene lengths, act breaks, and transition timing
- **Real-Time Updates**: When someone updates a cue, everyone sees it immediately
- **Multiple Versions**: Keep different drafts and iterations organized

**Example:** Your "Macbeth" show might have separate scripts for "Rehearsal Draft," "Tech Rehearsal," and "Performance Version."

### 🏛️ **Venues** - Your Space Information
**Venues** store all the practical information about where you're performing, rehearsing, or building.

**What Venues Include:**
- Contact information and addresses
- Technical specifications (lighting positions, sound system, etc.)
- Capacity and seating arrangements
- Special notes and restrictions

**Example:** "Main Stage Theater," "Rehearsal Room B," "Scene Shop"

### 🎨 **Departments** - Your Creative Teams  
**Departments** are how you organize the different areas of your production - just like in traditional theater hierarchy.

**Common Departments:**
- **Lighting** - All things related to lights and atmosphere
- **Sound** - Music, sound effects, and audio equipment  
- **Costumes** - Wardrobe, makeup, and character appearance
- **Set Design** - Scenery, props, and physical environment
- **Stage Management** - Coordination, scheduling, and communication
- **Performance** - Actors, directors, and artistic staff

### 👥 **Crew** - Your People
**Crew** members are the people who make your production happen, organized by their departments and roles.

**How Crew Works:**
- People can be assigned to multiple departments
- Different permission levels for different roles
- Easy communication within and across departments
- Clear responsibility assignments

## How They All Work Together

### The Connection Flow:
```
SHOW contains multiple SCRIPTS
SHOW happens at VENUES  
SHOW is organized by DEPARTMENTS
DEPARTMENTS are staffed by CREW members
CREW members work on SCRIPTS in VENUES
```

### Real-World Example:

**Show:** "Our Town - Fall 2025"
- **Scripts:** "Rehearsal Script," "Tech Script," "Performance Script"  
- **Venue:** "Black Box Theater"
- **Departments:** Lighting, Sound, Costumes, Stage Management
- **Crew:** 
  - Sarah (Lighting Designer) 
  - Mike (Sound Operator)
  - Jennifer (Costume Designer)
  - Alex (Stage Manager)

When Sarah adds a lighting cue to the Tech Script, Mike can see it immediately and coordinate his sound cues accordingly. Alex, as Stage Manager, can see all departments' updates and keep everyone coordinated.

## Why This Structure Works

### **Familiar Organization**
These elements match how theater productions are naturally organized, so there's no learning curve for understanding the basic structure.

### **Flexible Permissions** 
Your lighting designer doesn't need to see costume budget details, but they do need to see blocking notes that affect their cues.

### **Clear Communication**
Everyone knows where to find information relevant to their role, and updates flow to the people who need to know.

### **Production Evolution**
As your production develops from concept to opening night, all these elements evolve together while maintaining clear organization.

## Getting Practical

**Start Simple:** Create your Show, add one basic Script, and invite a few key people. You can always add complexity later.

**Think in Production Terms:** Don't worry about the technology - focus on organizing your production the way you naturally think about it.

**Experiment Freely:** You can always reorganize, rename, and restructure as your production develops.
