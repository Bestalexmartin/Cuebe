# Your First Production Setup

**A Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

## Before You Start

**Time needed:** About 15 minutes  
**What you'll create:** A complete production setup ready for your team  
**Don't worry about:** Getting everything perfect - you can always edit and improve as you go!

---

## Step 1: Create Your Show 🎭

Think of this as creating the master folder for your entire production.

### What You'll Enter:
- **Show Name:** Keep it simple - "Macbeth," "Our Town," or "Spring Musical 2025"
- **Performance Dates:** When are you actually performing? (You can add more dates later)
- **Description:** A brief note about the production - genre, style, or special notes

### Pro Tips:
- **Use familiar names** - your cast and crew should immediately recognize what production this is
- **Don't overthink it** - you can always edit this information later
- **Include the year** if you do the same shows regularly

---

## Step 2: Add Your Venue 🏛️

This is where your production will happen - your theater, rehearsal space, or performance venue.

### Basic Information:
- **Venue Name:** "Main Stage," "Black Box Theater," or "Downtown Auditorium"  
- **Address:** Where is it located?
- **Contact Info:** Key phone numbers or email addresses

### Technical Details (Optional for now):
- Stage dimensions
- Lighting positions  
- Sound system information
- Seating capacity

### Why This Matters:
Having venue information in one place means your designers can always check technical specifications, and your stage manager can quickly find contact information.

## Step 3: Set Up Your Departments 🎨

Departments are how you organize the different creative teams working on your production.

### Start With These Core Departments:
- **Stage Management** - Coordination and scheduling
- **Lighting** - All lighting design and operation  
- **Sound** - Music, sound effects, and audio
- **Costumes** - Wardrobe, makeup, and character appearance
- **Set Design** - Scenery, props, and physical environment

### Customize for Your Production:
- Add **Music Direction** for musicals
- Include **Choreography** for dance-heavy shows
- Create **Marketing** if you handle promotion
- Add **Box Office** for ticketing coordination

### Don't Worry About:
Getting every department perfect right now - you can always add, remove, or rename departments as your production develops.

---

## Step 4: Invite Your Core Team 👥

Start with the people you work with most closely - usually your key designers and stage management team.

### Who to Invite First:
- **Stage Manager** (if that's not you)
- **Lighting Designer**  
- **Sound Designer**
- **Director** (if you're not directing)

### How Invitations Work:
- Send them an invite through Cuebe
- They create their own account
- You assign them to the appropriate departments
- They immediately have access to everything they need for their role

### Permission Levels:
- **Viewers** can see information but not edit
- **Contributors** can add and edit content in their departments
- **Managers** can coordinate across departments
- **Admins** can manage the entire production

## Step 5: Create Your First Script 📖

This is where the magic happens - your living, collaborative script that everyone can access and update.

### Getting Started Options:

**Option A: Upload Existing Script**
- If you have a digital script (PDF, Word doc, etc.), you can upload it
- Cuebe will help you convert it into an editable, shareable format

**Option B: Start from Scratch**  
- Begin with scene and act structure
- Add dialogue and stage directions
- Build cues and technical notes as you go

**Option C: Import from Common Formats**
- Many schools and theaters use standard formatting
- Cuebe can import from most common script formats

### Your First Cues:
Don't try to add every cue at once! Start with:
- **Scene transitions** - when lights change or set pieces move
- **Major sound cues** - music, sound effects, or significant audio moments  
- **Blocking notes** - key movements or positions that affect technical elements

---

## Step 6: Test Collaboration 🤝

This is the fun part - seeing how your team can work together in real-time.

### Try This Together:
1. **Add a lighting cue** - have your lighting designer add a cue to a scene
2. **Update timing** - adjust the length of a scene based on rehearsal  
3. **Add a note** - put in a reminder or question that others can see
4. **Make a change** - edit something and watch others see the update immediately

### What to Look For:
- Everyone can see the same information
- Updates appear in real-time  
- People can add information relevant to their departments
- Nothing gets lost or overlooked

---

## Step 7: Organize Your Workflow 📋

Now that the basics are set up, establish how your team will use Cuebe throughout the production process.

### During Rehearsals:
- **Stage managers** update timing and blocking notes
- **Designers** add cues based on directorial decisions
- **Everyone** can see script changes immediately

### During Tech Week:
- **Technical notes** get added directly to relevant cues
- **Timing adjustments** happen in real-time
- **Problems and solutions** are documented as they're resolved

### During Performances:
- **Cue sequences** are locked in and easily accessible
- **Emergency contacts** are readily available
- **Show reports** can be generated after each performance
