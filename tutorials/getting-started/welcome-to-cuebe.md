# Welcome to Cuebe! 🎭

**Your Digital Stage Manager**

## What is Cuebe?

Think of Cuebe as your digital stage manager - the person who keeps track of everything, coordinates everyone, and makes sure your production runs smoothly from first rehearsal to closing night.

If you've ever juggled paper scripts covered in sticky notes, tried to coordinate lighting cues via text message, or wondered if the set designer got the memo about that last-minute change, Cuebe is here to help!
