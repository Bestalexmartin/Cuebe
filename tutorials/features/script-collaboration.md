# Script Collaboration Made Simple

**How Your Team Works Together on Scripts**

## The Old Way vs. The Cuebe Way

### The Old Way 😰
- Someone emails a script to everyone
- People print it out and make handwritten notes
- Changes get texted or called in during rehearsal  
- Multiple versions exist with different information
- Nobody's sure which version is "correct"
- Important updates get lost in email chains

### The Cuebe Way 🎉
- One script, always up-to-date, accessible to everyone
- Real-time collaboration - see changes as they happen
- Clear permissions - everyone can contribute what they need to
- Complete change history - never lose an important note
- Works on any device - phone, tablet, or computer

## How Real-Time Collaboration Works

### Everyone Sees the Same Thing
When your lighting designer adds a cue, your sound designer sees it immediately. When the director changes blocking, the stage manager's script updates automatically. No more "Did you get my email?" or "Check your texts!"

### Smart Permissions  
- **Lighting designers** can add lighting cues but don't need to edit dialogue
- **Stage managers** can coordinate everything and make timing adjustments
- **Directors** can add notes and make script changes
- **Actors** can access the latest version without accidentally editing it

### Change Tracking
Every edit is saved with who made it and when. If you need to undo a change or see how something evolved, it's all there in the history.

## Common Collaboration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Rehearsal Discovery 🎭
**What Happens:** During rehearsal, the director realizes a scene transition needs a sound cue.

**Old Way:** Director makes a note, remembers to tell sound designer later, hopes it doesn't get forgotten.

**Cuebe Way:** 
1. Director adds a note directly to the script: "Need transition music here"
2. Sound designer sees the note immediately (even if they're not at rehearsal)
3. Sound designer adds the specific cue with timing
4. Stage manager sees both the request and the solution
5. Everyone's on the same page without any extra communication

### Scenario 2: Technical Rehearsal Adjustments ⚡
**What Happens:** During tech, you discover a lighting cue needs to happen 3 beats earlier.

**Old Way:** Lighting designer makes a note, stage manager updates their script, sound designer might not know about the timing change.

**Cuebe Way:**
1. Lighting designer adjusts the cue timing in real-time
2. Stage manager sees the change immediately  
3. Sound designer can adjust their related cues accordingly
4. The change is documented and everyone stays coordinated

### Scenario 3: Last-Minute Script Changes 📝
**What Happens:** A line needs to change for legal or creative reasons.

**Old Way:** New script pages get distributed, people update their scripts manually, someone always misses the memo.

**Cuebe Way:**
1. Director or stage manager makes the change once
2. Everyone with access sees the update immediately
3. All related cues and notes automatically stay connected to the right place
4. No chance of someone working from outdated information

## Best Practices for Team Collaboration

### Start Simple, Build Complexity
- Begin with basic script structure and major cues
- Let each department add their specialized information gradually
- Don't try to input everything at once - let it grow naturally

### Establish Team Conventions
- **Agree on naming:** How do you want to label cues? (LX1, Light Cue 1, or Q1?)
- **Decide on detail level:** Some teams love extensive notes, others prefer minimal information
- **Set update schedules:** When will major changes be made? Before rehearsals? After?

### Use Clear, Descriptive Notes
**Instead of:** "Fix this"  
**Try:** "Lighting: Needs to be warmer, less intense"

**Instead of:** "Change"  
**Try:** "Sound: Replace doorbell with knock - doorbell is too modern for period"

### Respect Each Other's Work
- Don't delete someone else's cues without discussion
- Add your own notes rather than editing others' unless you're coordinating
- Use comments and questions to communicate rather than making assumptions

## Managing Different Types of Information

### Dialogue and Stage Directions
**Who Updates:** Directors, stage managers, sometimes actors (with permission)  
**What to Include:** Line changes, blocking notes, character direction

### Technical Cues
**Who Updates:** Relevant designers and technicians  
**What to Include:** Specific equipment settings, timing, coordination notes

### Performance Notes  
**Who Updates:** Directors, stage managers, sometimes performers  
**What to Include:** Character motivation, pacing notes, audience interaction

### Production Notes
**Who Updates:** Stage managers, producers, department heads  
**What to Include:** Scheduling changes, safety reminders, coordination information

## Handling Conflicts and Disagreements

### When People Disagree on Changes
**Use Comments:** Instead of changing each other's work, use the comment feature to discuss options.

**Example:**
- Sound designer adds: "Door slam cue at 'Get out!'"
- Director comments: "This might be too harsh - could we try a softer door close?"
- Sound designer replies: "How about a firm close rather than a slam?"
- Stage manager adds: "Let's try both in tomorrow's rehearsal"

### When Someone Makes a Mistake
**Don't Panic:** Every change is tracked - you can always undo or see what was changed.

**Communicate:** If you notice an error, mention it in comments rather than just fixing it silently.

### When Information Gets Overwhelming
**Use Department Views:** Focus on information relevant to your role without getting distracted by other departments' details.

**Regular Cleanup:** Periodically review and organize notes - remove outdated information and consolidate related items.

## Advanced Collaboration Features

### Version Control
Keep separate versions for different phases:
- **Rehearsal Script:** Working version with lots of notes and experimentation
- **Tech Script:** Cleaned up version with finalized technical information  
- **Performance Script:** Final version with only essential performance information

### Export and Backup
- Generate clean performance scripts for guest directors or understudies
- Create department-specific cue sheets
- Backup important versions before major changes

### Integration with Other Tools
- Export timing information for sound boards or lighting consoles
- Generate reports for production meetings
- Share read-only versions with people who don't need editing access

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I Can't See Someone's Changes"
- Check your internet connection - real-time updates need connectivity
- Refresh your browser or app
- Make sure you're looking at the right script version

### "Someone Deleted My Work"  
- Check the change history - it might have been moved, not deleted
- Look in comments - someone might have questions rather than making changes
- Contact your stage manager - they can help coordinate and restore if needed

### "There's Too Much Information"
- Use filters to show only information relevant to your department
- Hide completed or outdated notes
- Consider creating separate versions for different purposes

## Making the Most of Script Collaboration

### Remember the Goal
The point isn't to use every feature or have the most detailed script possible. The goal is clear communication and coordination that serves your creative process.

### Start Where You Are
If your team is used to paper scripts, start by recreating that digitally, then gradually add collaborative features as people get comfortable.

### Be Patient with Your Team
Some people adapt to new tools quickly, others need more time. Support each other through the learning process.

### Celebrate Success
When collaboration works well - when everyone stays coordinated, when changes flow smoothly, when nobody misses important information - acknowledge it! Good collaboration makes great theater possible.
